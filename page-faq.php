<h2>Running ownCloud</h2>
<a name="install"></a>
<h3>Where do I find information on how to use/install ownCloud?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You should start with the <a href="https://doc.owncloud.org" target="_blank">ownCloud Documentation</a></li>
	<li>There are a lot of tutorials and how-to's written for installing and managing ownCloud, to be found all over the internet. We collect a list on <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/core/wiki/Reviews-tutorials-and-videos-of-ownCloud"  target="_blank">this page</a> and our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtZe22ggl2YBi1u2dH0qg9fgnym5DwYbW" target="_blank">YouTube channel collects video tutorials</a> but if what you are looking for is not there, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=owncloud+installation+tutorial" target="_blank">Google</a> or another search engine can find them easily.</li>
	<li>The ownCloud forums have a <a href="https://forum.owncloud.org/viewforum.php?f=17" target="_blank">special FAQ page</a> where each topic corresponds to typical mistakes or frequently occurring issues</li>
</ul>
<a name="channels"></a>
<h3>I have a problem, what do I do?</h3>
<p>If the <a href="https://doc.owncloud.org" target="_blank">ownCloud Documentation</a> does not help and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=owncloud+installation+problem" target="_blank">Google</a> can't solve your problem either you should check out <a href="/support/">our support page</a>.</p>
<p>If you are using ownCloud in a business, educational setting or other professional or large scale deployments, note that the <a href="#entcomparison">ownCloud, Inc.</a> offers support contracts.</p>

<a name="chat"></a>
<h3>Where can I discuss ideas with other ownCloud users?</h3>
The best places for conversation are:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://forum.owncloud.org" target="_blank">the ownCloud Forums</a></li>

<a name="upgrade"></a>
<h3>I want to upgrade my ownCloud installation to the new release, how do I do that?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The manual upgrade process is described in the <a href="<?php echo $DOCUMENTATION_ADMIN; ?>/maintenance/upgrade.html" target="_blank">ownCloud Documentation</a>.</li>
	<li>If you installed ownCloud using Linux distribution packages and added the repository, an update will get them. You can also manually grab the new versions from <a href="/install/" target="_blank">owncloud.org/download</a></li>
	<li>The built in Update app will usually have new ownCloud releases available for upgrade some time in the week after a major release.</li>
</ul>

<a name="upgradeyet"></a>
<h3>Is it safe to upgrade to the new release?</h3>
<p>All code entering ownCloud has been reviewed twice as well as tested by both automated means and through the efforts of volunteers. Releases are done only when all issues we are aware of are fixed or can be mitigated easily. In short, ownCloud releases are always as stable as we could make it without <em>your</em> help. If you want the guarantee that it will work in your specific situation, <a href="<?php echo $DOCUMENTATION_DEVELOPER; ?>testing">make sure you help test before a release is made</a> so your issue can be fixed in time.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we need your testing?</strong></p>
<p>In short: because ownCloud is <em>yours</em>. ownCloud is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open Source</a> product, following an open development model. That means that many different stakeholders, both commercial and private, contribute to its development and share responsibility for the final release. ownCloud is thus neither owned nor controlled by any single entity.</p>
<p>By using ownCloud, <em>you become part of the ownCloud community</em>, sharing both ownership and responsibility for the product we collectively develop. Compare it to your responsibility for the functioning of your car: you regularly have to test it, or hire a garage for a checkup. It is yours, isn't it?</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<a name="rsync"></a>
<h3>Why does ownCloud use csync rather than rsync?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>rsync is a one-way syncing protocol. This means that if you have two servers and delete a file on one side, it will pop up again if you use rsync. To ensure old files get removed but new files added, and updated files overwritten, you need a N-to-N sync solution. ownCloud uses csync for syncing, which also deals with conflicts in a smart way.</li>
</ul>
<a name="language"></a>
<h3>Why is ownCloud Server written in PHP?</h3>
ownCloud is for everybody. We picked PHP because:
<ul>
	<li>PHP runs anywhere and is supported everywhere. Even the cheapest hosting provider should support ownCloud and PHP makes that possible.</li>
	<li>PHP is easy to learn which makes it easy for people to contribute. The ease of PHP also allows you to check the code that runs your ownCloud and make changes that you need.</li>
</ul>
In short, PHP lowers the barrier for using, auditing, modifying and contributing to ownCloud. And that is important!<br />
See more details in <a href="https://owncloud.org/blog/owncloud-and-php/" target="_blank">this blog about ownCloud and PHP</a>.

<a name="protocol"></a>
<h3>Why do you use HTTP and not $PROTOCOL?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>HTTP goes through every firewall and proxy.</li>
</ul>
<a name="android"></a>
<h3>Why does the calendar/contacts app not work with Android?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>iOS has native ical/caldav support, Android does not. You have to use an Android app that does but unfortunately almost all apps we're aware of that support caldav/ical are paid. One open source client is <a href="https://github.com/rfc2822/davdroid" target="_blank">DAVdroid</a>. You can find a list of <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/core/wiki/Apps" target="_blank">3rd-party apps which work with ownCloud here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="mobilefeatures"></a>
<h3>Why does the Android/iOS mobile app not support my favorite feature?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Android mobile app has automatic picture and video upload. Both mobile clients and give access to your files and include selective sync for keeping some of your files up to date on the device. Other features are under development or provided by other apps (like calendar and contacts, see <a href="#android">previous FAQ item</a>). If you'd like to add features to the Android or iOS client, find the <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/android/" target="_blank">Android sources here</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/ios" target="_blank">iOS sources here</a>. Legal notes: the Android app is under the GPLv2, the iOS app under the GPLv3. To contribute to either, you have to <a href="https://owncloud.org/contribute/agreement/" target="_blank">sign a contributor agreement</a> or contribute your code under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank">MIT license</a>. For testing, we provide a <a href="https://owncloud.org/contribute/iOS-license-exception/" target="_blank">iOS license exception</a> so you can run the iOS app on up to 100 devices.</li>
</ul>
<a name="security"></a>
<h3>How Secure is ownCloud?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ownCloud supports HTTPS and offers server-side encryption. ownCloud Server automatically generates a 4096-bit strong private/public key-pair for each user. Private keys are encrypted with the user’s login password and thus nobody can get at your data if you are not logged in on your ownCloud server.</li>
	<li>ownCloud is an open source project so all code is visible. We are committed to building secure code. We employ a full-time security expert and do regular security audits on the code. We always welcome fixes to security issues, see <a href="https://owncloud.org/security" target="_blank">owncloud.org/security</a>.</li>
	<li>To learn a bit more about ownCloud security, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJbMrLgowk&index=25&list=PLtZe22ggl2YCfEzrHbFCylXGLGYtsHm96" target="_blank">this technical talk at the ownCloud Contributor Conference</a> and read <a href="https://owncloud.org/blog/how-owncloud-uses-encryption-to-protect-your-data/" target="_blank">this article about ownCloud and encryption</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="security2"></a>
<h3>Does the long list of security advisories mean ownCloud is less secure than other solutions?</h3>
Rather the opposite. It signals that ownCloud is a mature project taking responsibility for its security.
<ul>
	<li>ownCloud is being used by many large corporations in security sensitive situations (including banks and defense agencies), see <a href="#entcustomers">ownCloud, Inc. customers</a> and has undergoes independent security audits. As an open source project, it benefits from a <a href="#communitysize">large number of eyes</a> looking at its code.</li>
	<li>We are highly committed to full, yet responsible disclosure of security issues, which is why we <a href="https://owncloud.org/security/advisories/">publish all potential security relevant issues</a> with a CVE. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures">CVE</a> is an international standard in security and availability of ownCloud CVE's means system administrators can easily see whether their infrastructure is vulnerable or not.</li>
	<li>No other open source file sync and share receives the scrutiny and security attention ownCloud has. While a lower or higher number of CVE's does not directly say anything about security by itself, issuing CVE's is part of widely accepted responsible vendor security practice.</li>
</ul>

<a name="encryption"></a>
<h3>Are files encrypted during sync?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Yes, we use TLS for sending and receiving files over the network so they are encrypted during transmission.</li>
</ul>
<a name="encryption2"></a>
<h3>Does ownCloud support file encryption on the server?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Yes, but the Encryption app is designed to protect your data on external storage, rather than on the server ownCloud runs on. In the current design, the server always has the keys to the data. They are encrypted by your password, but you can't trust that it is as secure as client-side encryption. ownCloud does not do client-side encryption because you can not have a web interface if the server can't read the files and the web interface (and sharing abilities!) are very central to ownCloud. So you will always need to be able to trust the server if you want to 'own' your data. Read more <a href="https://owncloud.org/blog/how-owncloud-uses-encryption-to-protect-your-data/" target="_blank">in this article</a>.</li>
	<li>If you really want client-side encryption, we recommend you look for other solutions. Of course, if you are sufficiently knowledgeable and skilled, you would be more than welcome to improve on the file encryption technology. If you are interested in supporting or working on this feature, check out <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/mirall/issues/275" target="_blank">github</a> for the latest state on the discussion about it and check out <a href="/contribute/" target="_blank">owncloud.org/contribute</a> to get started.</li>
</ul>
<a name="conflict"></a>
<h3>Why do I sometimes get conflict files and messages while syncing?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A conflict may be caused by two or more users editing the same files at the same time or while on the road before the files are synced. We do not merge changes to files like version control systems like git do; we don't modify user files, ever. So you will get two files, the one that was synced to the server first and the one you had locally modified in the same time. You can compare the file changes by hand and delete the local file once you're sure you did not lose data.</li>
</ul>
<a name="partialsyncing"></a>
<h3>Does ownCloud use delta-sync (only syncing file changes)?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>We introduced chunked, parallel up- and download with ownCloud 7 and the ownCloud 1.6 client. Syncing only file changes needs much deeper changes. It is on our roadmap, but won't be done soon. Find some <a href="https://dragotin.wordpress.com/2015/02/09/incremental-sync-in-owncloud/" target="_blank">background on that decision here</a>. If you want to speed up the development of this feature by working on it, see <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/mirall/issues/179" target="_blank">the github discussion</a>. If you really want this feature and would like to specifically fund work on it, see <a href="https://www.bountysource.com/issues/905030-sync-only-the-file-change-not-entire-file" target="_blank">the Bountysource page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="deduplication"></a>
<h3>Does ownCloud do file de-duplication?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>No, we think that that is the job of the file system. We do maintain versions of files as they are replaced and you may revert to older versions at any time.</li>
</ul>
<a name="syncspeed"></a>
<h3>Why is ownCloud syncing not faster?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The design of ownCloud is constrained by two important features: scalability and reliability.
	<ul>
		<li>ownCloud is designed to be very scalable, and be independent of the used storage system. We want it to work with terabytes of data and tens of thousands of users - and it does, organizations like CERN in Switzerland and big universities run ownCloud with such amounts of data and users. The downside of this is that it is hard use 'checksums' to see if files are changed: imagine doing that on terabytes of data on an external storage! What is fast for a few gigabyte or a few thousand files is would break entirely once you add a large movie- or music database, or start pumping scientific data through the system.</li>
		<li>A second design goal of ownCloud is reliability. We would rather be slower, but ensure no files are lost, than risk going fast-and-loose with user data. For example, the file-change-notifications on Linux and Windows are not 100% reliable in all cases, so just-to-be-sure we run a full file system scan every few minutes. Yes, that eats battery life, but it does ensure you do not lose any of your files!</li>
	</ul>
	This does not mean there is no room for improvement, we work very hard to make ownCloud faster and every release introduces many performance improvements. Also, help is always welcome. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/mirall/" target="_blank">client code on github</a> if you are interested in the challenges of fast, scalable and reliable file syncing! See <a href="/contribute/" target="_blank">the contribute pages</a> for more information about getting involved.</li>
</ul>

<a name="scaling"></a>
<h3>Does ownCloud scale to large deployments?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ownCloud can run on Raspberry Pi like development boards but is certainly not limited to low-end hardware. Worlds' largest on-premise cloud deployment services <a href="https://owncloud.com/sciebo-germanys-largest-cloud-project-500000-users-launches-today/" target="_blank">500,000 students on ownCloud</a> and terabytes of data are shared through ownCloud at organizations like the  <a href="http://cernbox.web.cern.ch/" target="_blank">atom smashers at CERN</a>. ownCloud founder Frank Karlitschek wrote a <a href="http://karlitschek.de/2015/03/scaling/" target="_blank">post about the scalability of ownCloud</a>.</li>
	<li>Of course, it does require some tuning to adopt ownCloud for large deployments. See our on documentation on <a href="<?php echo $DOCUMENTATION_ADMIN; ?>/configuration_server/performance_tuning.html">performance tuning</a> and the pages on <a href="<?php echo $DOCUMENTATION_ADMIN; ?>/operations/scaling_multiple_machines.html">scaling across multiple machines</a>. See also <a href="https://owncloud.com/whitepapers/">owncloud.com/whitepapers</a> and you can find excellent resources online, like <a href="http://www.severalnines.com/blog/high-availability-file-sync-and-share-deploying-owncloud-galera-cluster-mysql-and-glusterfs" target="_blank">this blog about a High Availability cluster with Galera for MySQL and glusterFS</a>, and this <a href="http://zdevops.tumblr.com/post/53590343974/glustercloud-running-owncloud-with-a-glusterfs" target="_blank">glusterFS and ownCloud blog</a>.</li>

</ul>

<a name="closedapps"></a>
<h3>Can I write closed source apps for ownCloud?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Yes, but only under the <a href="https://www.owncloud.com" target="_blank">ownCloud Enterprise Edition</a>, which supports integration with proprietary technologies.</li>
</ul>

<a name="notcrippled"></a>
<h3>Is ownCloud Server limited to a certain number of users or files and do I have to purchase something to get a 'full' version?</h3>
<p>ownCloud is open source, so artificial limitations have no place in it. It can sustain the same number of users, downloads or data as a version equipped with enterprise apps and a support contract.</p>

<a name="copyrightviolation"></a>
<h3>I want to report a copyright infringement or other legal matter on a site that mentions to use ownCloud.</h3>
<p>ownCloud is an open-source project that can be easily hosted by any person allowing anybody to securely exchange files. Neither the ownCloud open source project nor ownCloud, Inc. exert any legal or technical control over those domains. If you found a copyright infringement on a domain other than <a href="http://owncloud.org" target="_blank">owncloud.org</a> or <a href="http://owncloud.com" target="_blank">owncloud.com</a>, please try to contact the domain owner. ownCloud has no insight or control over ownCloud instances.</p>

<a name="modifyowncloud"></a>
<h3>Can I modify ownCloud and run it on my website for others to use/access?</h3>
<p>ownCloud Server is available <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html" target="_blank">under the AGPLv3</a>. In laymen terms (this is NOT legal advice!) the AGPL license grants you the right to run the ownCloud code wherever and however you want, make modifications and additions and share these with anybody you like. The only limitation is that if you give others access to your ownCloud (by giving them a user account or sharing files with them), you must also give them access to the source code; and the whole source (including your modifications) has to be under the AGPLv3 license.</p>
<p><strong>How to comply</strong></p>
<p>If you have made no modifications to the ownCloud code, the easiest way to comply with the AGPL is to have a small link to owncloud.org and note that users can find the code there.</p>
<p>If you have made modifications, contributing these to ownCloud is sufficient from our point of view. If you don't want or can't do that, you have to provide a way for users to download the modifications you made to ownCloud, including the modifications. Providing, upon request, a tarball, zip file or github repository is enough. Make sure they contain the copyright notice; the code has to be under the AGPLv3 or a compatible license like the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank">MIT license</a>.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>ownCloud apps (ownCloud apps like the calendar or music app from <a href="http://apps.owncloud.com" target="_blank">apps.owncloud.com</a>, as you would write following <a href="<?php echo $DOCUMENTATION_DEVELOPER; ?>/app/" target="_blank">the App Developer documentation</a>, using the public but internal API) are considered an integral part of ownCloud; writing an ownCloud app is thus considered modifying ownCloud and your ownCloud apps are subject to the requirements of the AGPLv3. The ownCloud <a href="#entcomparison">Enterprise Edition</a> provides <a href="#closedapps">an exception</a> as it is available under a proprietary license.</li>
<li>External apps like mobile or desktop clients, or apps running on another server and otherwise not part of ownCloud but using the external ownCloud OCS API as <a href="<?php echo $DOCUMENTATION_DEVELOPER; ?>/core/externalapi.html" target="_blank">you would find here</a> are NOT subject to the AGPLv3 and can be under any license you like.</li>
<li>Artwork is not subject to the AGPLv3: you can have a branded ownCloud installation, with modified logo, colors etcetera. You do NOT have to release your logo or other artwork under the AGPLv3.</li>
<li>If you use ownCloud yourself (as private user or company!) and do not give third parties access to its user interface or API's (like webDAV), the AGPLv3 sharing clause does not come into effect. In general, note that you are only ever obliged to share the original source <em>upon request</em> with a third party who has been given <em>access to your ownCloud instance</em>. You must merely make sure that users are aware of this right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact a lawyer if you are unsure about any of this - the above is not legal advice and we can not provide such.</p>
<h2>ownCloud Community</h2>
<a name="communitylocation"></a>
<h3>Where is the ownCloud community hosted?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The ownCloud code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/owncloud" target="_blank">github.com/ownCloud</a> and our website is on <a href="https://owncloud.org" target="_blank">owncloud.org</a></li>
</ul>
<a name="communitysize"></a>
<h3>How big is the ownCloud Community?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ownCloud has over 2 million users and over 360 programmers contributed code in the last 12 months. Tens of thousands participate on our forums, mailing lists, translation and documentation tools, and IRC channels in testing, discussions, translation, documentation and so on. See <a href="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2014/08/owncloud-numbers.html" target="_blank">this blog</a> for an analysis and dig into the statistics <a href="https://owncloud.org/blog/announcing-owncloud-community-statistics-provided-by-bitergia/" target="_blank">on Bitergia</a> so you can judge the health of our community yourself.</li>
</ul>
<a name="howitstarted"></a>
<h3>How did ownCloud get started?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ownCloud started with a keynote by Frank Karlitschek at Camp KDE’10 where he talked about the need of a self-controlled free and open source cloud. Two years later, Frank announced the start of ownCloud, Inc. which is headquartered in Lexington, Massachusetts in the United States and Nuremburg, Germany. Find out more on <a href="/contribute/" target="_blank">our history page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="getinvolved"></a>
<h3>How can I get involved in the ownCloud Community?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The best way to get started is to visit <a href="/contribute/" target="_blank">owncloud.org/contribute</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="notechknowledge"></a>
<h3>But what if I'm not very technical?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>There are lots of ways you can contribute to ownCloud. We have a need for developers, designers, event organizers, speakers, QA and more. It is all <a href="/contribute/" target="_blank">on the <em>contribute</em> page</a>!</li>
</ul>
<a name="appslocation"></a>
<h3>Where can I find ownCloud apps?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>There is a large selection of built in and community-approved apps available for download from within the App management screen in your ownCloud installation. Featuring apps like the Music app, the Calendar app and so on you can watch your movies, share your pictures and keep your bookmarks synced. Download is seamless (just 'enable' the app and wait while it is downloaded, installed and enabled) and upgrading is easy from the same screen.</li>
	<li>If the built in and approved apps are not enough, you can get more than 200 community and enterprise-developed ownCloud apps at <a href="https://apps.owncloud.com/" target="_blank">apps.owncloud.com</a> that have been developed with our open API. You can find apps in all categories: multimedia, PIM, productivity, games, tools and more. Note that unlike the apps available for download from the App Management screen in ownCloud, the apps on <a href="https://apps.owncloud.com/" target="_blank">apps.owncloud.com</a> are not extensively checked for safety and compatibility, so you should be careful with them. For this reason, we do not support automatic download and installation for these, but require users to download the apps and install them in their ownCloud by hand.</li>
	<li>If you are looking for third-party apps that integrate ownCloud in mobile and desktop applications, see our <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/core/wiki/Apps" target="_blank">3rd-party apps</a> page.</li>
	<li>Building a new ownCloud app is easy. If you're interested in developing your own ownCloud app, see <a href="/contribute/" target="_blank">the contribute page</a>, where you can find a link to the latest App Development documentation.</li>
