		<p>Sharing files across ownCloud servers is as easy as sending an email from a Gmail address to a Yahoo account! Instead of an email address, you use a Federation ID. And just like email, it looks like <strong>username@server</strong>, although there often is a string like 'ownCloud' attached at the end, like <strong>guy@fawkes.org/myowncloud</strong></p>
		<p>To share a file with somebody, just enter their Federation ID in the 'share' dialog and when they log into their own cloud, they will get a notification to accept your share.</p>
		<p>You can find your Federation ID in your user settings. Give it to your friends so they can share files with you!</p>
