        </div>
        <p>We recognize that privacy is extremely important to our users. We do not share individual user data with third parties without your permission. We use our own install of <a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a> and, sometimes, other third-party analytics services on our web sites to understand how people use our web pages. Our news letter is handled via Constant Contact, see their <a href="http://www.constantcontact.com/legal/privacy-statement">privacy policy</a>. Registration for ownCloud events is handled by websites we deploy and manage ourselves. If we experience a privacy breach, we promise to disclose it as soon as possible. If you spot a privacy leak, please report it discreetly to <a href="mailto:info@owncloud.com">info@owncloud.com</a>.</p>
