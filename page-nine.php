			<h2>Innovative Collaboration</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="featurewrapper">
			<p>With ownCloud, you can seamlessly collaborate on files and folders with others, add comments while working on files and organize files via tags. You keep an eye on what happens to your files through the activity feed, available in the Activity app, through RSS or in the ownCloud client apps. Notifications will pop up if files are shared or a calendar invitation comes in. The wide variety of applications developed in the ownCloud community brings additional collaborative capabilities like email handling, calendar and contacts and more.</p>

				<p class="featuredesc">You shared your holiday-to-Italy photos with your family. In the comments they discussed how great Venice looks. You easily follow the conversation and participate, either by looking at your global Activity Feed or the file-specific feed in the side bar. If you wrote in response about a picture of Naples that it was in Rome, you can even go back and edit your mistake.</p>
				<p class="featuredesc">Comments are new in ownCloud 9 and bring a whole new level of interaction to your files.</p>

				<p class="featuredesc">If you're handling large amounts of files for various projects you are working on, tagging is your friend. Assign tags to the files and when looking for them, just select the tag on the left side bar and only files with that tag are shown in the folder you're in.</p>
				<p class="featuredesc">The new tag support in ownCloud 9 will help you organize your data and find what you are looking for even faster.</p>

				<p>Notifications about new shares, calendar invitations or other events you should respond to are now separated out from Activities. They will show up with a little alarm icon next to your user name in the web application, pop up as desktop notifications or on your mobile phone thanks to the support being added to the desktop and mobile clients.</p>
<!-- 				Activities show what is happening to your data like modifications, comments, shares or downloads. You can follow what's going on in the Activities app or just see the changes made to a single file in the side bar. -->

You share a spreadsheet with a friend and edit it together, real-time, while you are chatting on the side. You give a colleague access to your contacts and calendars, use your own server to read your email, store your passwords and do countless more things thanks to the many ownCloud apps in the app store!</p>
				<p class="featuredesc">Both Calendar and Contacts have been updated for ownCloud 9 while the Mail app is a relative newcomer but getting into shape. Collaborations with Spreed and Collabora Cloudsuite are bringing web conferencing and real time document editing to ownCloud.</p>

		<a name="scalability"></a>
		<div class="featurewrapper">
			<h2>Ultimate Scalability</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="featurewrapper">
			<p>Your ownCloud has to get you the files you are looking for quickly and smoothly, even if it is serving hundreds of thousands of users or sharing terrabytes of data. With ownCloud being deployed in ever larger installations, scalability and performance are more important than ever. ownCloud has collaborated with large ownCloud users like CERN and X to bring the scalability of ownCloud to a new level. To be able to deliver petabytes of data to hundreds of thousands of users, key areas like the storage and sharing functionality of ownCloud have been improved.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row featurerow">
			<div class="col-md-7 featureblock">
				<img class="thumbnail" alt="documentation" src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/assets/img/features/tips.png" />
				<h3 class="featuretitle">New Storage API</h3></br>
				<p class="featuredesc">To be compatible with as many backend storage systems as possible, ownCloud is designed to store all file meta data in the ownCloud database. This includes information like sharing information, file IDs and more. It can be more efficient to hand some of the file handling and meta data storage off to backend storage systems that support, for example versions or file sharing. As the database can become a bottleneck in extremely large systems, offloading these file handling activities and meta data to an alternative location can improve performance, allowing the same hardware to scale to support even more users – particularly useful for extremely large instances. It also enables integrating in existing storage capabilities like version support.</p>
				<p class="featuredesc">In addition to better scalability and integration, the new storage API also enables ownCloud to leverage storage that has until now been unheard of in file access solutions - such as tape.  In this manner, ownCloud can bring files on any kind of storage to users with the same frictionless experience.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-5 featureblock">
				<img class="thumbnail" alt="faster" src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/assets/img/features/api.png" />
				<h3 class="featuretitle">Reworked Sharing</h3></br>
				<p class="featuredesc">With ownCloud you can share with whomever you like, choosing conditions and permissions for the recipient. When files are shared among large numbers of people or in complicated scenario's like folders with shares in them, shared to a third party who shares it back and so on, it becomes hard to determine what the logical and expected behavior would be.</p>
				<p class="featuredesc">ownCloud 9.0 introduces a rewritten and simplified sharing model, avoiding recursive sharing conflicts and making sure it is always clear who is the owner of a file and who has access to it.</p>

				<ul>
				    <li>Improved thumbnail generation engine and added preview support for fonts and 3D images.</li>
				    <li>Automatic database, trash and version cleanups don't cause system wide slow-downs anymore</li>
				    <li>With certain mail server configurations, setting the correct sender address now works</li>
				    <li>File meta data like sharing or favorite state is preserved when files are deleted and undeleted</li>
				    <li><a href="http://morrisjobke.de/2015/07/22/Conditional-Logging-in-ownCloud/" target="_blank">Conditional logging</a> extends logging to debug level when conditions you set are met</li>

				    <li>User avatars are shown in sharing dialogs</li>

			<h2>Full Federation</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="featurewrapper">
			<p>Not everybody you want to share files or collaborate with has an account on your ownCloud server - and they don't need to. You can share public links, protected by a password if you like. Even better, if the recipient has an ownCloud of their own, you can share with their Federated Cloud ID and connect your ownCloud servers. ownCloud 9 brings federation of ownCloud servers to a new level with better performance, name auto completion between servers and a finalized API.</p>

				<p class="featuredesc">You have a document you want to work on with a friend who has her own file sync and share server. You ask for her Federated Cloud ID, which she can find in her personal settings page, and share the file with her. She gets notified and can get your document like it was on her own server!</p>
				<p class="featuredesc">This ownCloud release brings performance improvements for federation and marks the finalization of the Federated Cloud Sharing API. At least one other file sync and share project is already working to implement the same API so it will be possible to collaborate between their users and ownCloud servers.</p>

Once a connection between servers is made by a first share, your system administrator can configure the list of trusted servers to ensure safe and easy collaboration between ownCloud servers.</p>
